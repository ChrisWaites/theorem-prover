# GodelMachine
Despite the fact that Mathematician Kurt Godel indirectly proved that computers could not successfully print every true statement of a formal system, I still want to try for non-paradoxical statements. The attempt to take on this challenge includes the creation of classes representing formal propositions, propositional functions, typographic equivalence methods, and a Set&lt;String> of the true conclusions.
